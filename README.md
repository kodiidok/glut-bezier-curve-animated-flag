# Animated Flag with Bezier Curves

This interactive computer graphics project showcases a dynamically animated flag using Bezier curves. Developed in OpenGL, the flag elegantly sways with smooth curves, creating a mesmerizing blend of mathematical precision and artistic motion.

## Features

- Bezier Curve Animation: The flag's movement is achieved through the animation of Bezier curves.
- Dynamic Color Palette: The flag gracefully transitions between vibrant colors, creating a visually appealing display.
- Real-time Interaction: Users can experience the interactive simulation and observe the flag's captivating motion.

## Usage

1. **Compile and Run:**
    ```bash
    g++ -o animated_flag animated_flag.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
    ./animated_flag
    ```

2. **Interaction:**
    - Watch the flag gracefully wave in response to Bezier curve animation.
    - Enjoy the real-time color transitions that enhance the visual appeal.
